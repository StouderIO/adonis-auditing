# Introduction

Adonis Auditing aims to provide strict control over the data that is being accessed, modified, or deleted in your application.
It is a powerful tool that offers a wide range of features to help you keep track of the changes made to your data.

One of the best things about Adonis Auditing is that it is very easy to use and configure. Simply use the `Auditable` mixin on your models and that's it!
Your models are now being audited and it provides you a way to access the audit logs.
